# AI_artnews_generator

This is an interactive, multi-agent website inspired by the design of Artsy and Gagosian websites. The platform allows users to generate formal art news (including article title, artist bio, two AI-generated photographs of the work, labels, and description) by inputting just four words, using Socket.io, Python, JavaScript, and OpenAI, along with Replicate API integration
